## Description
This is a timed quiz about the career of the NBA player LeBron James, each question has a value of 20 points.
There are different ways to interact with a webpage using JavaScript, in this challenge I noticed the importance of navigating the DOM, how we can create elements, change elements content en even delete elements from an html file by just using JavaScript code. This is a good way to make a webpage more interactive for the user. 

## Usage
- Once page loads the user will be presented with a start button and timer, once the start button is clicked, questions and answers will be shown to the user. Timer will start at 60 seconds and counting down.

- When question is answered wrong, 5 seconds will be subtracted from timer and no points will be added.
- When the user answers all questions, score and initials input will be displayed.
